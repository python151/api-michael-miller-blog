# Django-CORS-Template

This is a template for Django-CORS with login, signup, and session storage already implemented. This allows me to quickly start working on a project without having to spend too much time implementing the basic API implementation and start coding the actual project.

# Setup

This template already has urls and views implemented for login so when you need to add another feature like database access code it like you would normally (When your coding an API) and everything should work after you run 'python3 manage.py makemigrations' and 'python3 manage.py migrate'. 

# Running

This template is just like any other django application so you can run it after setup with 'python3 manage.py makemigrations'
